<h3>PART I.—THE DUTIES OF A HOSTESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> often thought that a few practical hints
relative to the preparations for and treatment of
a guest who comes to be a member of the household
for a while, would not, perhaps, be thrown
away upon the general company of readers. I
therefore venture to offer these hints in homely
fashion, feeling that I am, as it were, treading
upon almost new ground, for the matter is one
that appears to me to have been, considering its
importance, wonderfully little discussed.</p>

<p>Before entering upon my subject, I would
wish to say that my observations and advice
are not addressed to those heads of families
who have large establishments and a numerous
staff of servants at command; such, of course,
have merely to signify to the housekeeper or
upper housemaid that a guest is expected, and
give directions that such and such a room be
prepared: the green, the yellow, blue, or any
other colour, as the case may be. I desire rather
to write for those heads of houses who belong
to the middle classes, and for ladies who, for lack
of means, can afford to keep but one servant, or
at the most two.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be said that in the former
case a visitor ought not to be invited at all; but
that is mere nonsense, for there are times and
circumstances when such a mark of civility is
undoubtedly due, and when it cannot with propriety
be avoided; nor need there be any reason,
in a properly regulated household, why a guest
should not be lodged and entertained quite as
comfortably, if less luxuriously, in an unpretentious
dwelling as within the lordliest halls. Of
course, a great deal must depend upon the style
of living to which the visitor is accustomed. It
would, for instance, be unwise for a hostess with
limited means at her command to undertake the
entertaining of a wealthy nabob, who, from
being born with the proverbial silver spoon
in his mouth, knows nothing of difficulties or
struggles with the world, and is in consequence
a mere mass of selfish exactitude and
caprice. Nor would it be judicious for a person
of moderate income to invite a gourmet, who
lives to pamper his appetite, and is guilty of
such vulgar pomposities as passing the wines
beneath his nose before tasting them, in order
that he may boast of his knowledge of the
various vintages to which they belong. It is
likewise unwise for a host or hostess of limited
resources to extend an offer of hospitality to a
fine lady or gentleman who cannot travel without
a maid or valet in attendance upon them.
Strange servants are an intolerable nuisance
among a household, and it is usual for those
who have had experience of them, to declare
that they would rather entertain a dozen guests
in the dining-room than cater for one in the
kitchen or servants’ hall.</p>

<p>In the event of a hostess deeming it a necessity—which
sometimes occurs—to invite a guest whose
household and style of living are to her knowledge
superior to her own, she should not be in
the least ashamed to confess the fact, or feel in
the smallest degree embarrassed about doing so.
She should, on the contrary, refer to it—once
only—with easy grace, exhibiting no trace of
‘awkwardness,’ for there is not any shame in
being unable to cope with those who are wealthier
than ourselves, nor can riches ever weigh against
gentility of soul. Were we to ape what we
cannot have—to strive after position which we
cannot attain—to attempt style that we cannot
keep up—to cheat honest tradesmen out of their
lawful earnings in order to gratify some expensive
taste which we have no right to indulge—then,
indeed, might a blush lawfully arise; but there
is nothing in upright frugality to make even the
most sensitive feel ashamed.</p>

<p>I have said, refer to the matter once only,
because I consider it a sign of extreme bad taste
to keep perpetually offering apologies to visitors,
in the event of things not being quite so grand
or imposing as the hostess may desire. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">{354}</span>
frequently we are put to the pain of listening
to such sentences as: ‘Do, pray, take some more;
although I know it is not so good as you have
at home’—‘I hope you slept well, though I am
afraid you missed your own fine big room,’ &amp;c.
This display of deferential anxiety cannot be
otherwise than painfully embarrassing to a visitor,
and looks as though the hostess were either throwing
out perpetual hints for compliments upon
the excellence of her house and table, or as if she
were really uncomfortably conscious of deficiencies
which are perhaps noticeable to herself alone.
A few words—the briefer the better—spoken to
the guest on arrival, or inserted in the note of
invitation, are sufficient to answer all purposes:
‘You are aware, Miss—or Mr’ (as the case may
be), ‘that our means are not sufficient to admit
of any style; but I hope you will be comfortable,
and I am sure you will be welcome.’</p>

<p>A hostess of moderate income, such as I am
writing for, should always ascertain personally
that the bedchamber intended for her guest’s
use is comfortably arranged and the bed-clothing
properly aired. These are things which, if left
to the care of the ordinary run of servants,
will in most instances be performed in a very
slovenly manner. As I intend that these observations
shall be of a decidedly practical nature,
I shall state plainly my ideas respecting the
arrangement of a guest-chamber in an ordinary
middle-class house. Ignoring, then, the existence
of a family bathroom, the visitor’s apartment
should be provided with a bath, a large sponge,
and a plentiful supply of towels. The first of these
should be kept turned up in some spare corner
by day, and laid down at night by the chambermaid,
with a square of oilcloth or felt underneath,
to save the carpet from being wetted; for some
persons are very untidy bathers, and make a
terrible splashing when they indulge in a ‘tub.’
The sponge should be kept in a little basket,
made to hook on to the lower rail of the towel-stand,
which is in every way preferable to
keeping it in a bag. Care should be taken that
the looking-glass does not, when touched, make
a low salaam—the upper end coming down upon
the nose of the visitor, while the lower portion
departs out of sight! This is very frequently
the case in hotels and lodging-houses, and indeed
in too many private dwellings also; and it can
be so easily rectified by the bestowal of a little
care upon the screws, that it is quite wonderful
how persons can contentedly go on from month
to month propping up the disabled toilet-mirror—or
leaving others to do it—with a hairbrush,
or pocket-handkerchief, or half a newspaper
folded into a pad.</p>

<p>Be sure, also, if you are expecting a visitor,
to leave the wardrobe in the guest-chamber
perfectly empty, and all the shelves neatly swept
and papered. Be certain to attend particularly
to this matter, more especially if the expected
visitor be a lady, for it is pitiable to contemplate
the inconvenience which neglect of it may
entail. See that every article of clothing is
removed from drawers and wardrobe; and do
not from negligence leave half-a-dozen dresses
hanging up in the latter, or an array of laces
and fineries folded away in the former. Nothing
can possibly be more conducive to the discomfort
of a lady-guest than—just when she has bolted
her door and has divested herself of her outer
garments to dress for some dinner or dance—to
have the hostess knock and bounce in, with:
‘I <i>beg</i> your pardon; I know you won’t mind
<i>me</i>; but I find the dress I want to wear is
in your wardrobe.’ Or, ‘My opera-mantle is
stowed away in one of your drawers.’</p>

<p>I have occasionally stayed at houses, and very
frequently at hotels, where there was no such
thing in my room as a wardrobe at all, in any
shape or form—not even a shelved press, or a
clothes-rack on the wall. This is dire misery,
and is an unpardonable omission on the part of
those in authority over the management of affairs.
It is not by any means a matter of necessity
that a costly glass-panelled wardrobe should be
provided. Many households cannot afford such;
but a neatly painted one is not an extravagance;
and in the event of a narrow staircase or
doorway preventing ingress to such a piece of
furniture, there is an excellent plan for improvising
a wardrobe, which I have seen tried with
great success. Nail up a substantial clothes-rack
in a recess of the room; suspend a brass rod
across it, on which are curtains hung on rings,
and cover in the top with strong calico, leaving
a neat valance of the curtain-stuff, bordered with
fringe, to hang over the edge. Any place, in
short, which will allow of coats and dresses being
hung up, to prevent the creasing which they
suffer by folding, and to preserve them from dust,
cannot fail to be acceptable to a visitor, when
he or she comes to unpack.</p>

<p>Always make sure that the window-blinds
are in perfect working order. They are at
times too stiff, or too loose, or so much out of
gear that if drawn down at night they remain
immovable in the morning, and the guest is
obliged to dress in semi-darkness. See, also
that the windows themselves are properly in
order. Every window ought to be made to
open both at top and bottom, as this admits of
the immediate and thorough ventilation of the
room. If, however, through defective carpentering
in the first instance, the windows are hermetically
sealed at the top—as is too frequently the
case in old houses—make certain at all events that
the lower sash opens and shuts with ease, and
that when closed it does not admit a draught.
Above all things, see that means are provided
to prevent the shaking of windows in windy
weather. Few things are so aggravating to the
temper, and at the same time so wearying to
the constitution, as being kept awake at night by
the ceaseless and monotonous ‘bang, bang’ of a
loose window-sash, which, after all, can be very
easily remedied without adopting the old-fashioned
method of thrusting a toothbrush handle or rack-comb
between the sashes, to act as a sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">{355}</span>
wedge. Procure two neat flat pieces of wood,
about four inches in length; drill a hole in the
centre of each; affix one at each side of the
window-frame with a screw, which you must
not drive in too closely, but leave sufficient of
the head for the wood to revolve or move upon.
You will find that by slightly lifting the outer
or lower end of the wood, the other end becomes
pressed against the edge of the window-sash,
which it holds perfectly steady; and that by
declining or lowering this outer or lower end,
the sash is released from pressure. The plan
is an invention of my own; and I must not be
considered egotistical for saying that it is an
excellent one, as it will silence the noisiest
window in an instant of time. A small bar of
brass, treated in the same manner as the wood,
looks more ornamental, and is of course stronger,
where much pressure is desirable. Should there
be any aperture or draught, a neat piece of cloth
may be nailed along the sash, and will effectually
exclude it.</p>

<p>Take especial care that the carpet does not
wrinkle about the door, or in any other way prevent
its shutting. I have seen some extremely
awkward things occur from the neglect of this
precaution. A relative of mine, who was of a
very neat and systematic disposition, observed
upon one occasion that there was a great crease
in the carpet of his sitting-room at an hotel where
he went to stay; and being of a practical turn
of mind, he got out his own little hammer, and
with the aid of a tack or two, soon set matters
to rights. It happened, however, that the waiter
was in the habit of overcoming difficulties by
making a rush at the door; and as he followed
this plan an hour later, when carrying in a
heavy tray, the consequences were disastrous,
for the door flew open with the greatest ease,
and tray and waiter came tumbling into the room
together.</p>

<p>You should make sure, also, that the bolt and
lock of the door are in proper order. Many
persons cannot sleep easily unless their door is
fastened; and it is pleasanter for the hostess to
expend a few pence upon the mending of a lock
or bolt, than to hear her guest, at dead of night,
dragging a heavy box or table, or chest of
drawers, or some other unwieldy thing, across
the floor of the chamber, to barricade the door
against imaginary disturbances.</p>

<p>Ascertain, likewise, that there are night-lights,
matches, and a substantial taper left in the room—as
also writing materials, pins, hair-pins—if
the expected guest be a lady—perfume, and a
few amusing magazines or other specimens of
light literature, as well as the Book of books;
for some persons waken early, and enjoy a brief
spell of reading before getting up.</p>

<p>These may perhaps appear very minute details
to go into, but believe me the chamber in which
they have been thoroughly attended to—no matter
how plain and unpretentious it may be—will
prove infinitely more comfortable than the most
luxuriously furnished room in which they have
been overlooked.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is an excellent plan, in a limited household,
to have various matters connected with housekeeping
in readiness before the guest arrives.
A good supply of fresh table-napkins; a number
of knives, forks, and spoons arranged in a sideboard
drawer in the dining-room; a few plates
and glasses within the locker, in order to obviate
the necessity for continually ringing the bell;
a supply of sweets made; and a good marketing
laid in. Many persons deem this an impossibility
in warm weather; but few things are so,
if properly managed. There are many kinds
of sweets that will keep good for days; even
those in the manufacture of which milk has been
employed, will not sour if the milk be first
boiled and slightly flavoured, or if condensed
milk be used in place of fresh. Of course, a
great deal depends also upon keeping such things
in a perfectly cool atmosphere.</p>

<p>With regard to meat, a joint may be preserved
for many days by wrapping it loosely in a fine
cloth wrung out of vinegar, and hanging it in
a draught of air. If the weather be very warm,
the cloth must be remoistened twice, or even
thrice a day. Tinned provisions are excellent
in summer, and are invaluable in cases of emergency;
tongues, curries, and soups being amongst
the best of the eatables thus preserved.</p>

<p>A breakfast-table, to be comfortably set, should
have a separate tea or coffee equipage for each
individual, except in cases where the family is
very large; then one may be made to serve for
two persons. In like manner, no dinner-table can
be said to be properly appointed where there is
any handing about of salt-cellars, water-bottles,
or other necessaries; nor can there be any excuse
for it in these days of cheapness, when very neat
little salt-cellars of moulded glass can be had
for a penny apiece. I have even seen some
as low as half that price and yet quite presentable.</p>

<p>Do not exercise your mind too much about
amusing your guest. I have often thought that
in some foreign countries, and notably in many
parts of America, the relation of host and guest
was a sort of double slavery. The host has the
comfort and amusement of his guest so painfully
at heart, that both undergo, for the time being,
an amount of social misery that entirely spoils
the freedom and pleasure of the visit. In our
country it is different. Go to spend a week in
an Englishman’s house, and you may be sure
that neither your host nor hostess will bother
you with trifling matters unless you seem to
desire it. Everything goes on as though you
were not there, and yet, <i>per contra</i>, the house
and its belongings are practically yours so long
as you remain. I consider it the extreme of
bad taste to pursue a visitor with continual
offers of amusement. If treated as a member
of the family and suffered to amuse himself,
he will generally do very well, and will feel
much happier and more at ease than when
he is too closely looked after. I have heard
persons complain bitterly of undue attentions
and continual running after, from which they
have suffered far more acutely than if actually
neglected. ‘Where is Mrs Dash? Who is sitting
with her?’ cries the flurried hostess. ‘Good
gracious! is it possible she has been left by
herself? Go at once, Mary, or Julia, or Tommy,
and sit with her, and amuse her until I have
time to come.’ And all the while, perhaps, the
hapless Mrs Dash is struggling to get a letter
or two written, or a bill or account made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">{356}</span>
up, and is congratulating herself upon the unwonted
luxury of a few delicious moments of
absolute quiet. She is revelling in the thought
of being left alone, when, lo! Miss Mary, aged
ten, comes awkwardly in, and stands sniffing
in the window, or sits sideways upon the piano-stool,
strumming with one hand at the notes,
which is her idea of keeping the visitor company
until mamma comes. Or Master Tommy,
aged twelve, enters with a burst of noise, and
proceeds to relate to the afflicted guest how he
and Jack Jones are in the same Latin class;
and how said Jones is beyond him in Euclid,
though inferior in something else; and how
Brown licked Black for calling him a dunce—with
a variety of other information, by no means
interesting to unconcerned parties. To this
annoyance there are few of us who have not
been subjected. A greater error of judgment
can scarcely be committed. To make a guest
feel comfortable and at home, leave him pretty
much to his own devices. To be always striving
to amuse him is a poor compliment to his own
resources.</p>

<p>If in the winter-time a visitor comes to stay
in your house, inquire early whether he prefers
a fire in his bedroom at night, or a hot jar laid
into the bed. If the latter, so much the better;
it not only economises the coals, but is an immense
saving of trouble to the housemaid in
the mornings, as she has not then an additional
grate to make up.</p>

<p>During the stay of your guest, if a lady, do
not suffer her to pay anything towards the
expenses of cabs, trains, or laundry, neither to
defray the cost of her own concert or theatre
tickets. Whilst in your house, she is, or ought
to be, a member of your family, and it is not
worth while, for the sake of a trifling additional
outlay, to do anything which bears upon it the
smallest stamp of meanness. If, however, the
guest be a gentleman, there may—under certain
circumstances—be some little relaxation of the
rule; but where a lady is concerned, it cannot
be too stringently adhered to.</p>

<p>Opinions vary as to the propriety of inviting
a departing visitor to remain longer. The hostess
should, I think, be guided by circumstances and
surroundings. A lady cannot well press a gentleman
to stay, unless he be a special friend or
relative, or that it is her husband’s desire that
he should do so. It is, however, quite usual
to ask a lady to extend her visit a few days
beyond the time fixed by her for departure. Not
to do so would appear in most cases inhospitable,
or at all events coldly formal, which amounts
to much the same thing. It is an excellent plan,
however, when giving an invitation, to name
the time that the recipient of it is intended to
remain. ‘We shall expect you to come to us
for a fortnight;’ or, ‘Stay with us from Monday
to Thursday,’ will enable the guest to know precisely
the limit to which his visit ought to be
prolonged.</p>

<p>Make it a rule never to introduce any subject
that could be unpleasant or embarrassing to
a visitor. Avoid strictly the smallest allusion
to household worries, as also questions of politics
and religion; and if your household be, unhappily,
one in which family jars are at times wont to
figure, banish all such entirely out of view, for the
time at least, if not for all time, as nothing can
possibly be more painful to a guest than witnessing
bickerings upon subjects with which he
has no sort of sympathy. A visitor, remember,
can have but one feeling upon all such dreary
occasions: namely, an intense desire to get well
out of the way with all convenient speed.</p>

<p>Be careful, also, that your guest shall see
nothing of your share of household duties or
drudgery, otherwise he, or she, will be made to
feel excessively uncomfortable. A hostess who
presides over a limited establishment will have
many duties to perform, and countless little
matters to engage her attention and need her
helping hand; but a visitor should not on any
account be permitted to witness these things. A
well-bred orderly hostess will get her work done
quietly and without fuss, nor will she ever exhibit
that bustling, anxious demeanour which is the
characteristic of so many really kind and otherwise
excellent entertainers.</p>

<p>It will not be out of place here to speak a
warning word to ladies—mistresses of households—who
allow their overwhelming anxiety respecting
the success of the dinner preparations to
appear on their countenances during the progress
of the meal. Which of us is unfamiliar with the
flushed face, eager eyes, and look of tortured
suspense with which some hostesses regard the
carrying in of the various dishes? I am now, of
course, speaking of plain, old-fashioned family
dinners, where the joints and sweets are laid
upon the table. The hostess may be, and probably
is, engaged in conversation with the guest
who occupies the seat on her right or left hand,
as the case may be; but the preoccupied manner,
the wandering thoughts, the painful effort at
appearing interested in whatever topic may be
under discussion, are only too apparent—as are
likewise the harassed look if, on the lifting of
the covers, anything is discovered to be wrong,
and the palpable look of relief if, on the other
hand, there seems to be no reasonable ground
for apprehension or complaint. All such facial
reflexes of the soul can and ought to be avoided.
They are frequently the result of nervousness,
and are in such cases a misfortune, yet one which
is quite curable and capable of being easily overcome.
A hostess who cannot preserve her serenity
upon even the most crucial occasions, is lacking
in one of the most essential qualities of an entertainer.
The thoughtless spilling of her best wine,
the soiling of her whitest tablecloth, nay, even
the smashing of a whole trayful of her best old
family china, should not cause one muscle of her
countenance to change.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an affected ignorance respecting
the contents of the day’s bill of fare is at
times almost as fatal as the opposite extreme.
I was myself present at a dinner-party at which
one of the untutored stable-helpers had been
brought in, on an emergency, to assist. ‘What
are these, John?’ inquired the languid hostess,
as John tremblingly thrust forward a dish of
tartlets just under her right elbow. ‘I don’t
know ma’am, raally,’ he replied; ‘but I think
they’re tuppence apiece!’</p>

<p>I shall conclude this portion of my subject by
remarking, that if a hostess has a lady-visitor in
her house and does not keep a carriage, she
ought, when the guest is about to depart, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">{357}</span>
make arrangements that a cab or other vehicle
shall be in waiting at the door in good time, to
convey the visitor to train, boat, or whatever else
may lead to her destination. Gentlemen are
usually understood to see after such matters for
themselves.</p>

Harry Noel continued to stop on at Orange Grove
for some weeks together, retained there irresistibly

He couldn’t tear himself away from Nora. And
Nora, too, though she could never conquer her

change after Tom Dupuy and the other sugar-growing
young gentlemen of Trinidad! He had
some other ideas in his head beside vacuum
pans and saccharometers and centrifugals; he
could talk about something else besides the
crop and the cutting and the boiling. Harry
was careful not to recur for the present to
the subject of their last conversation at Southampton;
he left that important issue aside for
a while, till Nora had time to make his acquaintance
for herself afresh. A year had passed since
she came to Trinidad; she might have changed
her mind meanwhile. At nineteen or twenty,
one’s views often undergo a rapid expansion.
In any case, it would be best to let her have
a little time to get to know him better. In
his own heart, Harry Noel had inklings of a
certain not wholly unbecoming consciousness
that he cut a very decent figure indeed in
Nora’s eyes, by the side of the awkward, sugar-growing
young men of Trinidad.</p>

<p>One afternoon, a week or two later, he was
out riding among the plains with Nora, attended
behind by the negro groom, when they happened
to pass the same corner where he had already
met Louis Delgado. The old man was standing
there again, cutlass in hand—the cutlass is the
common agricultural implement and rural jack-of-all-trades
of the West Indies, answering to
plough, harrow, hoe, spade, reaping-hook, rake,
and pruning-knife in England—and as Nora
passed, he dropped her a grudging, half-satirical
salutation, something between a bow and a
courtesy, as is the primitive custom of the
country.</p>

<p>‘A very murderous-looking weapon, the thing
that fellow’s got in his hand,’ Harry Noel said,
in passing, to his pretty companion as they
turned the corner. ‘What on earth does he want
to do with it, I wonder?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that!’ Nora exclaimed carelessly, glancing
back at it in an unconcerned fashion. ‘That’s
only a cutlass. All our people work with cutlasses,
you know. He’s merely going to hoe up
the canes with it.’</p>

<p>‘Nasty things for the niggers to have in their
hands, in case there should ever be any row
in the island,’ Harry murmured half aloud;
for the sight of the wild-looking old man ran
strangely in his head, and he couldn’t help
thinking to himself how much damage could
easily be done by a sturdy negro with one of
those rude and formidable weapons.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ Nora answered with a childish laugh,
‘those are just what they always hack us to
pieces with, you know, whenever there comes
a negro rising. Mr Hawthorn says there’s very
likely to be one soon. He thinks the negroes
are ripe for rebellion. He knows more about
them than any one else, you see; and he’s
thoroughly in the confidence of a great many
of them, and he says they’re almost all fearfully
disaffected. That old man Delgado there,
in particular—he’s a shocking old man altogether.
He hates papa and Tom Dupuy; and I believe
if ever he got the chance, he’d cut every one
of our throats in cold blood as soon as look at
us.’</p>

<p>‘I trust to goodness he won’t get the chance,
then,’ Harry ejaculated earnestly. ‘He seems a
most uncivil, ill-conditioned, independent sort of
a fellow altogether. I dropped my whip on the
road by chance the very first afternoon I came
here, and I asked this same man to pick it up
for me; and, would you believe it, the old wretch
wouldn’t stoop to hand the thing to me; he
told me I might just jump off my horse and
pick it up for myself, if I wanted to get it!
Now, you know, a labourer in England, though
he’s a white man like one’s self, would never have
dared to answer me that way. He’d have stooped
down and picked it up instinctively, the moment
he was asked to by any gentleman.’</p>

<p>‘Mr Hawthorn says,’ Nora answered, smiling,
‘that our negroes here are a great deal more
independent, and have a great deal more sense
of freedom than English country-people, because
they were emancipated straight off all in one
day, and were told at once: “Now, from this
time forth, you’re every bit as free as your
masters;” whereas the English peasants, he says,
were never regularly emancipated at all, but
only slowly and unconsciously came out of
serfdom, so that there never was any one day
when they felt to themselves that they had
become freemen. I’m not quite sure whether
that’s exactly how he puts it, but I think it is.
Anyhow, I know it’s a fact that all one’s negro
women-servants out here are a great deal more
independent and saucy than the white maids
used to be over in England.’</p>

<p>‘Independence,’ Harry remarked, cracking his
short whip with a sharp snap, ‘is a very noble
quality, considered in the abstract; but when it
comes to taking it in the concrete, I should much
prefer for my part not to have it in my own
servants.’</p>

<p>(A sentiment, it may be observed in passing,
by no means uncommon, even when not expressed,
among people who make far more pretensions
to democratic feeling than did Harry Noel.)</p>

<p>Louis Delgado, standing behind, and gazing
with a malevolent gleam in his cold dark eyes
after the retreating buckra figures, beckoned in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">{358}</span>
silence with his skinny hand to the black groom,
who came back immediately and unhesitatingly,
as if in prompt obedience to some superior
officer.</p>

<p>‘You is number forty-tree, I tink,’ the old man
said, looking at the groom closely. ‘Yes, yes,
dat’s your number. Tell me; you know who
is dis buckra from Englan’?’</p>

<p>‘Dem callin’ him Mistah Noel, sah,’ the black
groom answered, touching the brim of his hat
respectfully.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, I know him name; I know dat
already,’ Delgado answered with an impatient
gesture. ‘But what I want to know is jest dis—can
you find out for me from de house-serbants,
or anybody up at Orange Grove, where him fader
an’ him mudder come from? I want to know
all about him.’</p>

<p>‘Missy Rosina find dat out for me,’ the groom
answered, grinning broadly. ‘Missy Rosina is
de young le-ady’s waitin’-maid; an’ de young
le-ady, him tell Rosina pretty well eberyting.
Rosina, she is Isaac Pourtalès’ new sweetheart.’</p>

<p>Delgado nodded in instantaneous acquiescence.
‘All right, number forty-tree,’ he answered,
cutting him short carelessly. ‘Ride after buckra,
an’ say no more about it. I get it all out ob
him now, surely. I know Missy Rosina well,
for true. I gib him de lub of Isaac Pourtalès
wit me obeah, I tellin’ you. Send Missy Rosina
to me dis ebenin’. I has plenty ting I want to
talk about wit her.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="OLD_CITY_TREES">OLD CITY TREES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> might seem to many, at first sight, almost
ludicrous to be directed to search for poetry in
that most prosaic of all places, the Old City of
London. The busy cry of ‘commerce,’ which all
day long deafens the ear and deadens the finer
senses, excludes all thoughts beyond those which
tend to the discovery of the state of the various
markets—the price of stocks, the rate of exchange
at Paris, Berlin, or St Petersburg—the condition,
in fact, of all the monetary and mercantile affairs
in the world. Yet if these ‘toilers’ had a moment
to spare, and would look around them and
reflect, they would find that there are spots in
the City which have inspired many a poet.</p>

<p>Starting for a ‘walk down Fleet Street,’ and
entering at the Middle Temple gate, we come
upon a scene which has been immortalised by
Shakspeare—the scene of the original factions of
York and Lancaster. In this garden, Plantagenet
says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Since you are tongue-tied, and so loath to speak,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In dumb significance proclaim your thoughts:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let him that is a true-born gentleman,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And stands upon the honour of his birth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To which Somerset replies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Let him that is no coward, nor no flatterer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But dare maintain the party of the truth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the background of this garden, with its fine
trees and flowers, where the great dramatist
placed, in his imagination, this historical incident,
may be seen the old walls and buttresses of the
Middle Temple Hall. The descent into the garden
is after the Italian fashion, from a court, in the
centre of which stands that celebrated fountain
of which nearly every noted author has spoken.
Who does not remember Ruth Pinch—that
devoted sister of Tom’s, in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>,
walking under the trees in Fountain Court, and
meeting there—by the merest accident, of course—her
lover? ‘Merrily the fountain leaped and
danced, and merrily the smiling dimples twinkled
and expanded more and more, until they broke
into a laugh against the basin’s rim, and vanished.’
There is a graceful poem by L. E. L. (Miss
Landon) on this much admired and petted fountain
in the Temple Gardens:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The fountain’s low singing is heard on the wind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a melody bringing sweet fancies to mind:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some to grieve, some to gladden; around them they cast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hopes of the morrow, the dreams of the past.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Away in the distance is heard the vast sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the streets of the city that compass it round,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the echo of fountain’s or ocean’s deep call;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet the fountain’s low singing is heard over all.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is no place, one can see from reading
Charles Lamb, which he loved more than the
Temple to wander in. ‘What a transition for a
country-man visiting London for the first time,’
he remarks in his <i>Essays</i>, ‘the passing from the
crowded Strand or Fleet Street by unexpected
avenues, into its magnificent, ample squares, its
classic green recesses!... What a collegiate
aspect has that fine Elizabethan hall, where the
fountain plays, which I had made to rise and fall,
how many times!’ Among the Temple trees
there was formerly a colony of rooks, brought
there by Sir Edward Northey, a well-known
lawyer in the time of Queen Anne, from his
house at Epsom. The thought had in it a
touch of humour. The rook, both in his
plumage as well as in his habits, is a legal
bird: he is strongly addicted to discussions,
lives in communities, and has altogether the
grave appearance of a ‘learned brother.’ But
these rooks have ceased to assemble in the
Temple Gardens for many years.</p>

<p>For a long time, also, a favourite residence of
rooks was that beautiful tree which still stands
at the left-hand corner of Wood Street, on turning
out of Cheapside. As late as 1845, two new nests
were built there; and a trace of them is still
visible. The spot where the tree stands marks
the site of the church of St Peter-in-Cheap, a
church destroyed by the Great Fire. The terms
of the lease of the low houses at this west corner,
with their frontage in Cheapside, forbid the erection
of another story, it is said, or the removal
of this tree. Is it possible that Wordsworth, passing
one summer day down Cheapside, observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">{359}</span>
the tree, and gained the inspiration which led to
the <i>Reverie of Poor Susan</i>?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At the corner of Wood Street, when daylight appears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hangs a thrush that sings loud—it has sung for three years;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor Susan has passed by the spot, and has heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the silence of morning the song of the bird.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis a note of enchantment. What ails her? She sees</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A mountain ascending, a vision of trees;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bright volumes of vapour through Lothbury glide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a river flows on through the vale of Cheapside.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Within one of the inner courts of the Bank of
England there is a garden tastefully planted with
trees and shrubs, some of considerable age; and
in the centre there springs forth a large fountain,
mushroom-shaped, which plays during the office
hours for the benefit of the clerks who inhabit
that portion of the building, and for the ‘toilers’
who pass in and out with their bills of exchange
and their bags of gold. The sparrows which congregate
here flutter from branch to branch, twittering,
‘as though they called to one another,’ as
Charles Dickens describes it, ‘Let us play at
country;’ a place where ‘a few feet of garden,’
he says in <i>Edwin Drood</i>, ‘enable them to do that
refreshing violence to their tiny understandings.’
This green spot, like many others still to be seen
in the City of London, was once a churchyard;
it belonged to the church of St Christopher in
Threadneedle Street.</p>

<p>But one of the greenest spots in the City,
although only a corner of it remains, is perhaps
Drapers’ Hall Gardens. It is shut in on all sides
by newly constructed mansions, and only those
who have business to transact among the stockbrokers,
who have their offices in these buildings
behind Throgmorton Street, have any suspicion of
its existence. It may be reached by wandering
through courts and alleys; it has almost a park-like
appearance, if you are fortunate enough to
gain a glimpse of it from an elevated and slightly
distant point of view. Here there is also a
fountain visible among the trees. But how
different this garden once was! In the sixteenth
century it was an estate, the property of Thomas
Cromwell, Earl of Essex. It was purchased from
him, in the reign of Henry VIII., by the Drapers’
Company. The gardens then extended northwards
as far as London Wall, and commanded a
fine view of Highgate and the adjoining heights.
In Ward’s <i>London Spy</i>, it is spoken of as a
fashionable promenade an hour before dinner-time.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of the Monument and
of Thames Street, these gardens may be met
with at nearly every turning by those who care
to wander into nooks and corners in search of
them. By walking up St Mary-at-Hill out of
Thames Street, and entering through a narrow
iron gateway with bars like a prison, above
which may be seen in stone a grinning skull
and crossbones, one comes upon some fine trees
with their branches extending overhead in the
passage-way. Or, again, when descending St
Dunstan’s Hill, hard by, what is more beautiful
in the City than the trees in the churchyard of
St Dunstan, with the gray and black masonry of
the church, against the green leaves, with its four
lofty towers rising above?</p>

<p>To the account of the trees and gardens mentioned
above may be added a short statement
of many others existing in out-of-the-way nooks
and corners within the boundary of the city of
London. Many of the small open patches where
these trees are found were once undoubtedly
burial-grounds of churches, or the sites of
churches long since taken down. After the beautiful
grounds of the Temple, the only other large
open spaces within the boundaries of the City are
Finsbury Square, Finsbury Circus, Charterhouse
Square, and Trinity Square. All these are well
laid out with grass, shrubs, trees, and flowers, and
are used as promenading places by the inhabitants.
It should be here mentioned that the trees
referred to in this notice are all young, or at
most middle-aged, and that no such thing as a
really ‘old’ tree exists anywhere within the City
of London.</p>

<p>We will now continue our ramble, or tour
of inspection; and starting from Temple Bar, we
proceed eastward down Fleet Street. Here the
first trees we notice are two or three small and
sickly specimens growing in the churchyard of
St Bride, Fleet Street; they are not very ornamental,
or much to look at. Passing on up
Ludgate Hill, St Paul’s Cathedral is reached.
The grounds round the church are prettily laid
out, and contain many trees, but all young, small,
and weedy. Just to the east of St Paul’s, in
Watling Street, is a little inclosure very neatly
planted with shrubs only, and having in its midst
a large square altar-tomb of some departed City
worthy. This spot was once a burying-ground,
or the site of a church long since removed.
Proceeding eastward, and turning down Queen
Street, just out of Cannon Street, two tall and
rather fine plane-trees are observed growing in
the front of a grand old mansion, once, of course,
the residence of a City magnate, but now cut up
and let out as offices. These planes are worthy of
remark as affording one of the few instances now
occurring of trees found in private grounds inside
the City.</p>

<p>We now pass up Queen Street into Cheapside,
and thence into Aldersgate Street. Here we find
the ground, once the churchyard of St Botolph,
Aldersgate, has been beautifully laid out as a
garden, planted with trees, flowers, and shrubs,
and furnished with numerous seats, and affording
a delightful promenade or resting-place in summer-time,
and is much enjoyed by the immediate
neighbourhood. Another plot of ground, lying
on the west, but belonging to Christ Church,
Newgate Street, has also been planted and laid
out; but, because it belongs to another parish,
it is separated from the St Botolph’s garden by a
low wall and railing, although the two grounds
actually adjoin.</p>

<p>Continuing our walk northward, we arrive at
Charterhouse, once celebrated for its high-class
school, which has now been removed into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">{360}</span>
country. Adjoining, is Charterhouse Square, laid
out with trees, shrubs, and grass like an ordinary
London square, and surrounded by private dwellings.
Returning south, and then going east, we
reach St Alban’s, Wood Street, which has a little
ground round it, decorated with four trees and
shrubs. Close by is St Mary-the-Virgin, Aldermanbury,
with four trees round it. Just beyond
is a small churchyard that once belonged to St
Mary, Staining, containing two trees and shrubs;
and a little farther is St Olave, Jewry, with six
trees and shrubs, all weedy and sickly.</p>

<p>Passing on into Cannon Street, we turn down
Lawrence Poultney Hill, where we discover a
disused burial-ground, with a public passage-way
passing through the midst of it. The plot is
planted with eighteen sickly-looking, weedy trees,
large and small, as well as some stunted shrubs.
Passing over King William Street, we reach the
top of Lombard Street, where one little sickly-looking
tree is seen in front of the church of
St Mary Woolnoth. Continuing down Lombard
Street, and turning to the right, we come upon
the disused burial-ground of St Nicholas Acon,
situated in Nicholas Lane. This little plot is very
neatly laid out with shrubs, and planted with
three small trees. Passing on into King William
Street, we ultimately reach London Bridge, where,
close by in Thames Street, we find the large
church of St Magnus-the-Martyr, with its tall
and peculiar tower and spire, near the Monument.
It has no churchyard, but a small inclosed
space round it contains a dozen unhealthy-looking
young trees. A little beyond this, close
to the church of St Mary-at-Hill, three trees are
observed growing in what is apparently the private
ground or garden in the rear of a dwelling-house.
A few minutes farther east, we come to the fine
church of St Dunstan-in-the-East, standing in the
midst of a well-kept churchyard, and having ten
goodly young trees, of fair height and girth, which
always have a very agreeable appearance in the
summer-time. Still farther on east, we come to
St Olave, Hart Street, with its little churchyard,
planted with ten small trees; and close by we
see the church of Allhallows (Barking), Tower
Street. This fine old church is one of the few
which escaped the great fire of 1666. It stands
in a roomy churchyard, decorated with twenty-four
trees, and having somewhat the appearance of
a village church and churchyard.</p>

<p>We now emerge into one of the most interesting
spots in all London, interesting not only in an
historical sense, but peculiarly so from the
terrible tragedies of which it was so constantly
the theatre—namely, Tower Hill. This vast
space, extending from the Tower gates northward
to the Trinity House, was once entirely
open; but now a small portion of its northern
extremity is inclosed and neatly planted with
grass, shrubs, and trees. As the Tower itself
is situated outside the City boundaries, we must
not include its trees and plantations in this
notice, which strictly applies to trees in the
City only. We therefore turn our steps westward;
and in a little court, leading from
Mark Lane to Fenchurch Street, called Star
Alley, we come on a curious relic of the past,
a gray medieval church tower, square in shape,
with its stair turret at one corner, which once
belonged to the church of Allhallows (Staining),
Mark Lane. The nave of the church has long
since been removed, and the small plot of ground
round the old tower is now prettily laid out
with six young trees, many shrubs, yuccas, and
other ornamental plants.</p>

<p>Threading our way to Bishopsgate Street, we
find the churchyard of St Botolph, through which
a public footway leads to a neighbouring street.
The ground, right and left, is tastefully laid out
as a garden with pretty shrubs and trees, the
effect being pleasing and agreeable, especially in
summer. Nearly opposite is the ancient church
of St Ethelburga, hidden behind the houses, with
a small confined space at the back, in which are
fine trees. Two or three more trees are found
in a small inclosure in the vicinity at the back
of this church. Close by is also the curious and
interesting church of St Helen, Bishopsgate, and
in the ground round it are four ill-looking, scraggy
trees.</p>

<p>Returning southward, and reaching Cornhill,
we find a little burial-ground in the rear of the
fine church of St Michael, Cornhill, neatly laid
out, and planted with three small trees. Close
by is another large church, St Peter-upon-Cornhill,
with its small confined churchyard, also
neatly laid out, and planted with two small
unhealthy-looking trees.</p>

<p>Taking our way westward, we pass Christ’s
Hospital in Newgate Street. The boys’ playground
is a large open <i>paved</i> courtyard, destitute
of grass, trees, or shrubs; but in the private
gardens in the rear, trees, shrubs, and flowers
are to be found, having a pleasant appearance.
A little way beyond, we find St Andrew’s,
Holborn, and in the open churchyard surrounding
the church are many trees, but not much cultivation.
Passing through the quaint old gateway,
we find ourselves in the interior of Staple Inn,
Holborn, with its Hall and gardens. The latter
are neatly laid out with grass, shrubs, and trees,
and carefully kept, affording a quiet retreat from
the noise and racket of Holborn during the
bright days of summer.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may perhaps be worthy of
remark that nearly all the places referred to are
very small indeed, mere ‘garden nooks;’ some
are churchyards surrounding churches; and for
these reasons, apparently, none of them are open
for the use of the public as places of recreation,
except the cultivated churchyards of St Paul’s
Cathedral, and St Botolph, Aldersgate, close by;
and the squares of Finsbury, Trinity, and Charterhouse,
which are open to the immediate residents.
St Botolph, Bishopsgate, has, as already stated,
a footway through its prettily laid out churchyard.</p>

<p>It is at least remarkable how trees will
suddenly appear in the City in the most out-of-the-way
corners, where a green leaf would be
about the last thing looked for; yet such is the
case, as it has already been shown. There are
two sickly, scraggy, young trees in a little court,
up a narrow dirty lane, on the south side of St
Paul’s Cathedral, and at Stationers’ Hall, where
no one would dream of looking for vegetation;
and two or three more in Barnard’s Inn, Holborn,
an inn devoted to law and lawyers. The
peculiar character of ‘City trees,’ in nearly all
cases, is that they are lanky, thin, and generally
poor and unhealthy looking. It is rare,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">{361}</span>
indeed, to find a tall, well-grown tree in any
of these odd nooks and corners of the old City;
perhaps the three finest in size and height are
two plane-trees in front of a private house—now
used as offices—in Queen Street, Cheapside;
and the well-known single tree at the corner of
Wood Street, Cheapside; but these instances are
few and far between.</p>

</div>


<h3 title="CHAPTER I.">A STORY IN FOUR CHAPTERS.—CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Quinians</span>—that quaint little town which
nestles in a valley close by the cruel, tumbling
North Sea—looked forward, sixty years ago,
to market-day as the one weekly break in the
monotony of its existence, just as it does now.
On Wednesdays, Saint Quinians became the centre
to which active life converged from a score of
villages and hamlets that regarded it as their
metropolis. Wednesday was a point in the
calendar upon which hinged all arrangements, and
by which all events were calculated: people met
upon Wednesday who never saw each other at
any other time; and the news of Wednesday
was the latest obtainable by many folk even at
an epoch when forty coaches left London every
evening. And if Saint Quinians’ shopkeepers
looked forward to Wednesday as their busy day—if
the farmers looked forward to it as the link
which bound them with the outer world—if the
local youth saved up their money and their
spirits, and let them both out on Wednesday,
Bertha West, who lived with her father in a
solitary house on the shore, some four miles from
the town, looked forward to it as the day when
she met her sweetheart, Harry Symonds, and
spent the happiest hours of her week. Every
Wednesday, Harry Symonds met her at the old
South Gate—the only one remaining to tell of
days when Saint Quinians was a port of some
fame, and contributed its quota of ships and men
to the national navy—and if she was prevented
from coming, a very miserable week was in store
for the young man, as John West, the father of
Bertha, did not approve of the attachment, for
the rather selfish reason, that if his daughter
married, he was left alone in the world.</p>

<p>They had been sweethearting in this semi-clandestine
manner for more than a year, and
Harry Symonds was beginning to face mentally
the awkward problem of what was to be done,
should the old man persist in his opposition
to the match. Not only this; but the young
man was aware that the pretty girl whom he
had learned to regard as his own inalienable
private property was the object of very marked
attention on the part of a certain Jasper Rodley,
a youth who bore no very high character in the
town, who had suddenly disappeared from it for
three years, and had as unexpectedly returned;
and although Harry trusted Bertha implicitly,
he thought that a settlement of affairs would be
an advisable step. And so when, one bright
spring Wednesday morning, he met the girl
coming with her market baskets on her arm
along the path over the sandhills, she observed
that his face was serious, and very naturally
jumped at the conclusion that something was
wrong.</p>

<p>‘Why, Harry,’ she exclaimed, ‘there’s a face
for a lover to make who sees his sweetheart
only once a week! There’s nothing wrong, is
there?’</p>

<p>‘No, dear,’ replied the young man, his face
instantly brightening at the sound of her voice;
‘there’s nothing wrong. I’ve been thinking,
that’s all. And how are matters at home?
How’s the father?’</p>

<p>‘Just as usual, Harry. Father’s been depressed
all the week; but I’ve got him to set to work
on his flagstaff and battery with two real guns,
so that he’ll be all right.’</p>

<p>‘I wonder what depresses him?’ asked Harry.
‘You’ve always described him as such a jovial
old seadog.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know; but ever since the <i>Fancy Lass</i>
was wrecked, he’s been different at times.’</p>

<p>‘And Mr Rodley—has he been annoying you
with any of his attentions lately?’ asked Harry.</p>

<p>‘No. But I’ve seen him more than once about
our house.’</p>

<p>‘How did he find out where you lived? And
what is he doing there?’</p>

<p>Bertha shook her head, and said: ‘I don’t
know. I seem to think that there has been some
acquaintance formed between father and him.
He has never been inside the house, to my
knowledge; but I fancy they meet now and
then.’</p>

<p>The young man was silent for a few moments;
then he continued: ‘Well, never mind, Bertha.
So long as we are true to each other, he cannot
come between us. He’s a queer fellow, and people
say odd things about him. If you remember,
he disappeared from Saint Quinians about the
same time that my sad business with the bank
took place.’</p>

<p>‘You mean, when the bank’s sovereigns were
stolen, and you were dismissed for cul—cul—— What
was it, Harry?’</p>

<p>‘Culpable negligence, my dear.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, that was it; and a great shame it was!’
cried the girl warmly. ‘I wonder where the
sovereigns went to?’</p>

<p>‘Ah! where indeed?’ asked Harry. ‘They
were never traced. But old Cusack, our cashier,
who disappeared with them, took good care that
they never should be traced. It’s my belief
that they went to sea, for three thousand pounds
in sovereigns are not carried away so easily.
However, after all, it did me no harm. Every
one agreed that I was cruelly treated. I got a
new berth immediately; and I’m much better
off now than I should have been if I’d remained
in the bank’s service; so well off, in fact, Bertha,
that I’m beginning to think it almost time
for us to come to some decision as to what
we shall do.’</p>

<p>‘O Harry! there’s plenty of time to think
about that; and it’s—it’s so pleasant making
love; and besides, I must break it gently to
father, for he has no idea of parting with me
yet.’</p>

<p>‘But he surely can’t expect that you should
spend your life in that tumble-down old smuggler’s
cottage.—Hillo! there’s Rodley, skulking
about like a whipped cur. We’ll go on.’</p>

<p>So the happy pair proceeded into the market,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">{362}</span>
Harry holding the girl’s baskets whilst she made
her usual purchases, until the clock striking
ten warned the young man that he was due
at his office. He saw Bertha on her road home
as far as the South Gate, and was hurrying across
the market-place, when he caught sight of Jasper
Rodley walking swiftly in the direction taken
by Bertha. He stopped and watched. He saw
Rodley catch the girl up just as she was disappearing
beneath the archway, raise his hat,
and continue by her side in spite of Bertha’s
evident annoyance. Harry Symonds retraced his
steps so far that he could watch the progress of
the pair out of the town. Suddenly, he observed
Mr Rodley attempt to put his arms round
Bertha’s waist, whereupon the girl struggled, got
free, and ran on.</p>

<p>This was too much for Harry. He ran out
by the gate, and, coming up to Bertha and her
tormentor, said to him: ‘Mr Rodley, what do
you mean by daring to force your attentions
where they are not wanted?’</p>

<p>Jasper Rodley, a tall, well-built young fellow,
of about Harry’s age and size, started at first;
but, shoving his hands into his pockets, surveyed
his questioner for a moment with disdain,
and asked: ‘And what has that to do
with you, Mr Dismissed Bank-clerk?’</p>

<p>Harry was itching to thrash him on the spot;
but respect for Bertha’s presence induced him to
bottle up his wrath as best he could, and reply:
‘You’ve no right to bother any girl if she doesn’t
want to have anything to do with you. And
look here—your character hereabouts isn’t so
high that you can afford to call other people
names, so I warn you to keep a civil tongue
in your head, or something might be done that
you wouldn’t like, and something might be said
that would make you look a little small.’</p>

<p>This last bit was added at random, but it
seemed to have a strange effect upon Rodley,
who turned pale for a moment, but recovered
himself and retorted: ‘Done and said, indeed!
You couldn’t do much that I’m afraid of, and
at anyrate people couldn’t say of me what they
do of you. How about these sovereigns, eh?’</p>

<p>‘Look here, Rodley. If I did my duty, I
should give you a thrashing on the spot. Just
be off.—Miss West is betrothed to me. That’s
enough. Do you hear?’</p>

<p>Jasper Rodley walked off, with a savage scowl
on his face and an imprecation on his lips.</p>

<p>‘O Harry dear!’ cried the girl, who was
trembling with fright, ‘I’m so glad you didn’t
fight.’</p>

<p>‘Fight with a cur like that!’ exclaimed Harry.
‘Men of his kidney don’t fight.—What has he
been saying to you, my darling?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, such terrible things, Harry! He says that
he will marry me whether I like it or not—that
father is in his power, and has consented; and
that I had better make up my mind to give you
up before it is too late.’</p>

<p>‘Why, what on earth can he mean? Your
father in the power of a rascal like that—to consent
to your marrying him! He’s only trying
to frighten you. And yet you say that you
have seen him with your father. I think I shall
tackle Mr Jasper at once and make him explain
his dark speeches. There’s one thing—I’m not
going to have him continue his tormenting of
you, whether your father is in his power or
not.—And now, good-bye, dearest; you’re safe
now.’</p>

<p>So the girl pursued her homeward road; and
Harry Symonds walked rapidly back into the
town. Just within the gate, he came up with
Jasper Rodley. ‘Rodley,’ he said, ‘I’m going
to the office to give an excuse for my absence.
Kindly wait here until I come back, as I want
to speak to you.’</p>

<p>‘If you want to speak to me, you’d better
do so at once; I’ve other things to attend to,
and I’m not going to hang about here waiting
for you.’</p>

<p>‘Very well, then,’ said Harry; ‘let’s go where
people can’t remark us. Here, we’ll turn on to
the ramparts.’</p>

<p>So they went along the pleasant walk which
ran upon what had been, in old, stirring times,
the walls of Saint Quinians, a broad path, bounded
by shrubs and trees on one side, and by the deep
stony ditch on the other.</p>

<p>‘I want an explanation from you,’ said Harry,
‘about what you have just said to Miss West
concerning her father being in your power and
your determination to marry her.’</p>

<p>‘That’s easily given,’ replied Rodley. ‘At a
word from me, old Captain West could be ruined
and disgraced. I’m as much in love with
Bertha’——</p>

<p>‘Miss West, if you please.’</p>

<p>‘I said “Bertha,” and I repeat it,’ continued
Rodley. ‘I’m as much in love with her as you
are, and I intend to marry her. If I can’t marry
her, I ruin her father.’</p>

<p>‘How can you ruin him?’</p>

<p>‘It’s very likely I should tell you—isn’t it?’
answered Rodley with a sneer.</p>

<p>‘I intend to find out.’</p>

<p>‘Very well then, find out,’ retorted Rodley.—‘And
now I must be off.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t go until I have an explanation,’
cried Harry. ‘I don’t believe a word of what
you say, and I believe you are only trying to
terrify the poor girl into submission.’</p>

<p>‘Come now, Symonds, don’t be a fool; we’re
men of the world, and it’s time we understood
one another. I tell you once and for all, if
Bertha West does not marry me, I’ll have her
father up in the felon’s dock.—There; I’ve said
more than I intended, so good-morning.’</p>

<p>He endeavoured to push past Harry; but the
latter barred the way, saying: ‘You’ll have poor
old Captain West up as a felon! Why, man,
you’re mad! A simple old man like that, who
never stirs beyond his garden, who never said
an evil thing of any one, much less did a
wrong to any one! Come, be more explicit.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve said more than I intended,’ continued
Rodley; ‘and you don’t get another word out
of me.’</p>

<p>Again he tried to get past Harry, and again
Harry prevented him, saying: ‘Neither of us
shall budge from here until I find out more
about this.’</p>

<p>Rodley made a desperate effort to get past
Harry. The two men struggled together, and
as they were evenly matched in weight and
strength, the issue was doubtful. Suddenly,
Rodley loosened his hold of Harry’s arms,
stooped, caught him by the legs, and jerked him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">{363}</span>
over the steep side of the rampart. Harry fell
heavily, struck a projecting mass of stone half-way
down, and rolled amongst the sharp stones
and rubbish at the bottom, where he lay motionless
and bleeding. Rodley did not stop to look
after him, but walked rapidly back into the
town.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TRIAL_BY_ORDEAL">TRIAL BY ORDEAL.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most remarkable judicial systems of
olden times was the trial by ordeal, a mode of
procedure founded on the presumption that,
should a person be wrongfully accused, heaven
would interpose, and in some marked way make
his innocence undeniable. With the exception
of China, this test was of almost universal adoption
in the middle ages; and, whilst still surviving
amongst the uneducated portion of most
civilised communities, is even nowadays largely
practised by uncultured races. As far as its
origin is concerned, it may be traced back to
remote antiquity; and the bitter water by which
conjugal infidelity was revealed—an ordeal pure
and simple—will readily occur to the biblical
student as an interesting instance in Hebrew
legislation and history. Herodotus relates how
King Amasis—whose reign immediately preceded
the invasion of Cambyses—‘was, when a private
person, fond of drinking and jesting, and by no
means inclined to serious business. As soon,
however, as means failed him for the indulgence
of his amusements, he used to go about pilfering;
and such persons as accused him of having stolen
their property—on his denying it—were wont
to take him to the oracle of the place, where
he was oftentimes convicted, and occasionally
acquitted.’ The Greeks had their ordeals, a good
illustration of which occurs in the <i>Antigone</i> of
Sophocles, where the soldiers offer to prove their
innocence in various ways:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ready with hands to bear the red-hot iron,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To pass through fire, and by the gods to swear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That we nor did the deed, nor do we know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who counselled it, nor who performed it.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This mode of purgation, the scholiast tells us,
was in common use at that time.</p>

<p>There was also the water ordeal, and a certain
fountain near Ephesus was specially employed
for this purpose. As soon as the accused had
sworn to her innocence, she entered the water
with a tablet affixed to her neck, on which was
inscribed her oath. If she were innocent, the
water remained stationary; but if guilty, it
gradually rose until the tablet floated. Traces
of the same system are to be met with in the
history of ancient Rome; and amongst notable
instances may be quoted that of the vestal
Tucca, who proved her purity by carrying water
in a sieve; and that of Claudia Quinta, who
cleared her character by dragging a ship against
the current of the Tiber, after it had run
aground, and resisted every effort made to remove
it. But, as Mr Lea points out in his essay on
<i>The Ordeal</i>, ‘instances such as these had no
influence on the forms and principles of Roman
jurisprudence, which was based on reason, and
not on superstition. With the exception of the
use of torture, the accused was not required to
exculpate himself. He was presumed to be
innocent, and the burden of proof lay not on
him, but on the prosecutor.’</p>

<p>The ordeal trial prevailed in France from
before the time of Charlemagne down to the
eleventh century. The ancient Germans, too,
were in the habit of resorting to divination; and
their superstitious notions, writes Mr Gibson,
led them to invent many methods of purgation
or trial now unknown to the law. It should
be added, also, that the Germans were specially
tardy in throwing off this relic of barbarism;
for, at a period when most vulgar ordeals
were falling into disuse, the nobles of Southern
Germany established the water ordeal as the
mode of deciding doubtful claims on fiefs;
and in Northern Germany it was instituted for
the settlement of conflicting titles on land.
Indeed, as recently as the commencement of the
present century, the populace of Hela, near
Danzig, twice plunged into the sea an old woman,
reputed to be a sorceress, who, on persistently
rising to the surface, was pronounced guilty, and
beaten to death. Grotius mentions many instances
of water ordeal in Bithynia, Sardinia, and other
countries, having been in use in Iceland from
a very early period.</p>

<p>In the primitive jurisprudence of Russia, ordeal
by boiling water was enjoined in cases of minor
importance; and in the eleventh century we find
burning iron ordered ‘where the matter at stake
amounted to more than half a grivna of gold.’
A curious survival of ordeal superstition still
prevails to a very large extent in Southern
Russia. When a theft is committed in a household,
the servants are summoned together, and
a sorceress is sent for. Should no confession
be made by the guilty party, the sorceress rolls
up as many little balls of bread as there are
suspected persons present. She then takes one
of these balls, and addressing the nearest servant,
uses this formula: ‘If you have committed the
theft, the ball will sink to the bottom of the
vase; but if you are innocent, it will float on
the water.’ The accuracy of this trial, however,
is seldom tested, as the guilty person
invariably confesses before his turn arrives to
undergo the ordeal.</p>

<p>Again, in Spain, trial by ordeal was largely
practised; and it may be remembered how, during
the pontificate of Gregory VII., it was debated
whether the Gregorian ritual or the Mozarabic
ritual contained the form of worship most acceptable
to the Deity. When the chance of deciding
this contest amicably seemed hopeless, the nobles
resolved to arrange the controversy in their
customary manner, and, according to the historian
Robertson, the champions—one chosen by either
side—met and fought. But in the year 1322,
in Castile and Leon, the Council of Palencia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">{364}</span>
threatened with excommunication all concerned
in administering the ordeal of fire or water—a
circumstance which is important, as pointing
to the disappearance of this mode of trial in
Spain.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the practice of trial by ordeal
was under the Danish kings substituted for the
trial by combat, which, until the close of the
ninth century, had been resorted to among
the Danes for the detection of guilt and the
acquittal of innocence. In Sweden, says Mr
Gibson, the clergy ‘presided at the trial by
ordeal; and it was performed only in the sanctuary,
or in the presence of ministers of the
church, and according to a solemn ritual.’ And
yet, as he rightly observes, its abolition in
Europe was due to the continued remonstrances
of the clergy themselves. One form of ordeal
practised in Sweden was popularly known as
the <i>trux iarn</i>, and consisted in the accused
carrying a red-hot iron, and depositing it in a
hole twelve paces from the starting-point. In
accordance with the accustomed mode of procedure,
the accused fasted on bread and water
on Monday and Tuesday, the ordeal being held
on Wednesday, previous to which the hand or
foot was washed. It was then allowed to touch
nothing until it came in contact with the iron,
after which it was wrapped up and sealed until
Saturday, when it was opened in the presence
of the accuser and the judges.</p>

<p>In the years 1815 and 1816, Belgium, says
Mr Lea, was disgraced by ordeal trials performed
on unfortunate persons suspected of witchcraft;
and in 1728, in Hungary, thirteen persons suspected
of a similar offence were, by order of
the court, subjected to the ordeal of cold water,
and then to that of the balance. Referring to
the ordeal of the balance, Mr Tylor informs
us that the use of the Bible as a counterpoise
is on record as recently as 1759, at Aylesbury
in this country, where one Susannah Haynokes,
accused of witchcraft, was formally weighed
against the Bible in the parish church. In
Lombardy, ordeal by hot water was a form
of procedure much resorted to; and in Burgundy
this was also supplemented by the trial
by hot iron.</p>

<p>The instances thus quoted show how universally
practised throughout Europe in bygone
years was the trial by ordeal; and if we would
still see it employed with the enthusiastic faith
of the middle ages, we must turn to eastern
countries, where, owing to the slow advance of
civilisation, many of their institutions still retain
their primitive form. Indeed, as Mr Isaac
Disraeli remarks, ‘ordeals are the rude laws of
a barbarous people who have not yet obtained
a written code, and not advanced enough in
civilisation to enter into the refined inquiries,
the subtle distinctions, and elaborate investigations
which a court of law demands.’ This is
specially true in the case of India at the present
day, where the same ordeals are practised
as were in use five or six centuries ago. Thus,
the guilt or innocence of an accused person is
still tested by his ‘ability to carry red-hot iron,
to plunge his hand unhurt in boiling oil, to pass
through fire, to remain under water, to swallow
consecrated rice, to drink water in which an idol
has been immersed, and by various other forms
which retain their hold on public veneration.’
Professor Monier Williams, too, says that trial by
ordeal is recognised by the code of Manu, and
quotes the subjoined rules: ‘Let him cause a
man (whose veracity is doubted) to take hold of
fire, or dive under water, or touch the heads of
his wife and sons one by one. The man whom
flaming fire burns not and water forces not up,
and who suffers no harm, must be instantly held
innocent of perjury.’</p>

<p>In Japan, ordeals extensively prevail; and
amongst the many superstitious practices kept
up, we are told how the ‘goo’—a paper inscribed
with certain cabalistic characters—is rolled up
and swallowed by an accused person, this being
commonly supposed to give him no internal rest,
if guilty, until he confesses. A similar mode
of procedure is practised by the Siamese, and
under a variety of forms was prevalent in former
years. With it, too, we may compare the mouthful
of rice taken by all of a suspected household
in India, which the thief’s nervous fear often
prevents him from swallowing.</p>

<p>Formerly, this practice was observed in our
own country with the corsned or trial-slice of
consecrated bread or cheese. Even now, says
Mr Tylor, peasants have not forgotten the old
formula: ‘May this bit choke me if I lie.’</p>

<p>In Tibet, a popular ordeal consists in both
plaintiff and defendant thrusting their arms into
a caldron of boiling water containing a black
and white stone, victory being assigned to the
one who is fortunate enough to obtain the white.
Such an even-handed mode of procedure, if generally
used, must, as Mr Lea remarks, ‘exert a
powerful influence in repressing litigation.’</p>

<p>Among further curious specimens of ordeal
trial mentioned by this author may be noticed
those in use in certain parts of Africa. Thus,
the Kalabarese draw a white and black line on
the skull of a chimpanzee, which is then held up
before the accused, ‘when an attraction of the
white line towards him indicates his innocence,
or an inclination of the black towards him pronounces
his guilt.’ In Madagascar, a decoction
of the nut of the Tangena—a deadly poison—is
administered to the accused. If it act as an
emetic, this is considered a proof of innocence;
but if it fail to do so, the guilt of the accused
is confirmed. Dr Livingstone describes a similar
ordeal as practised in Africa, and tells us how
‘when a man suspects that any of his wives
have bewitched him, he sends for the witch-doctor,
and all the wives go forth into the field,
and remain fasting till that person has made an
infusion of the plant called “foho.” They all
drink it, each one holding up her hand to heaven
in attestation of her innocence. Those who vomit
it are considered innocent; but those whom it
purges are pronounced guilty, and put to death
by burning. The innocent return to their homes,
and slaughter a cock, as a thank-offering to their
guardian spirits.’</p>

<p>It should be noted, too, that such modes of
trial have been introduced with much effect
into medieval poetry and romance. Thus, says
Mr Gibson, ‘there was the mantle mentioned in
a ballad of which Queen Guenever is the principal
heroine, and which is supposed to have
suggested to Spenser his conceit of Florimel’s
girdle.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">{365}</span></p>

<p>Lastly, as far as our own country is concerned,
trial by ordeal existed from a very early period.
When the Anglo-Saxons were unable to decide
as to the guilt of an accused person, they invariably
resorted to this test, the law requiring that
the accuser should swear that he believed the
accused to be guilty, and that his oath should
be supported by a number of friends who swore
to their belief in his statement and to his general
truthfulness. Trials of this kind, however,
were often fraudulently conducted. Thus, when
William Rufus caused forty Englishmen of good
quality and fortune to be tried by the ordeal
of hot iron, they all escaped unhurt, and were
acquitted. But upon this the king declared that
he would try them by his own court. According
to the legendary account, it was by this mode of
ordeal that Queen Emma, the mother of Edward
the Confessor, was tried in order to clear her
character from the imputation of an intrigue with
Alwyn, Bishop of Winchester. Then there was
the ordeal known as the ‘corsned,’ or morsel of
execration, already alluded to, which consisted of
a piece of bread, weighing about an ounce, being
given to the accused person, that, if he were guilty,
it might cause convulsions and paleness and
find no passage; but turn to health and nourishment
if he were innocent. The sudden and fatal
appeal to this trial by Godwin, Earl of Kent,
in the year 1053, when accused of the murder
of Ælfred, the brother of Edward the Confessor,
ranks amongst the most curious traditions of
English history. Hallam relates how ‘a citizen
of London, suspected of murder, having failed in
the ordeal of cold water, was hanged by order of
Henry II., though he had offered five hundred
marks to save his life. It appears as if the
ordeal were permitted to persons already convicted
by the verdict of a jury.’</p>

<p>Ordeals were abolished in England about the
commencement of Henry III.’s reign. An edict
dated January 27, 1219, directs the judges then
starting on their circuits to employ other modes
of proof, ‘seeing that the judgment of fire and
water is forbidden by the Church of Rome.’
Matthew Paris, enumerating the notable occurrences
of the first half of the thirteenth century,
alludes to the disuse of the ordeal. But it was
no easy matter to root out such a deep-rooted
superstition, instances of which were of constant
occurrence. Thus, the belief that the wounds of
a murdered person would bleed afresh at the
approach, or touch, of the murderer long retained
its hold on the popular mind; and in a note to
the <i>Fair Maid of Perth</i>, we are told how this
bleeding of a corpse was urged as an evidence
of guilt in the High Court of Justiciary at Edinburgh
as late as the year 1668. An interesting
survival of this notion still exists in the north
of England, where we are told that ‘touching
of the corpse by those who come to look at it
is still expected by the poor who visit their house
while a dead body is lying in it, in token that
they wished no ill to the departed, and were in
peace and amity with him.’</p>

<p>Another of the few ordeals that still linger
in popular memory may be seen occasionally in
some country village, where persons suspected of
theft are made to hold a Bible hanging to a key,
which is supposed to turn in the hands of the
thief—a survival of the old classic and medieval
ordeal described in <i>Hudibras</i> as ‘th’ oracle of sieve
and shears, that turns as certain as the spheres.’
But instances of this kind are mostly confined
to the uncultured part of the community, for,
happily, ordeals have long since had their day,
and are now discarded from the laws of the more
civilised nations.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_NORMAN_STRONGHOLD">A NORMAN STRONGHOLD.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lover of antiquity may well lament when
he sees our ancient fortresses nearly levelled to
the ground; but the friend of rational freedom
will rejoice, when he reflects on the design for
which such works were erected, and on the
many calamities to which they have given occasion.
Amongst the existing but dismantled and
ruined fortresses connecting the present with the
sanguinary scene of strife and bloodshed of the
past, is the famous castle of Pontefract, in Yorkshire,
which sustained two memorable sieges by
Cromwell’s soldiery. This celebrated edifice is
supposed to be of Saxon origin; and the site
of it is perfectly agreeable to their mode of fortification.
While the Romans formed their camps
on a plain or on the level ground, and defended
them by a fosse and a vallum, the Saxons raised
the area of their camps and castles, if the ground
was level, or selected hills as places best adapted
for defence and security. The elevated rock on
which the castle is built stands wholly insulated,
forming a site which, without much trouble or
expense, might soon be converted into a stronghold.
In support of the theory as to its Saxon
origin, it may be mentioned that, since the
demolition of the castle, it has been found that
the great round tower stood upon a raised hill
of stiff hard clay, of which material the Saxons
usually made their foundations.</p>

<p>After the Conquest, Ilbert de Lacy received
a grant of the place, and about 1076, all his
vast possessions being confirmed to him, he soon
after began to erect the castle. This noble structure
cost immense expense and labour, and no
one, unless in possession of a princely revenue,
could have completed it. This formidable structure
and magnificent palace was carried forward
for the space of twelve years with unremitting
attention. Ilbert de Lacy, when he laid the
foundation stone of the castle, gave it the name
of Pontfrete, because the situation, as he conceived,
resembled the place so called in Normandy
where he was born. Historians, however,
have differed much respecting the origin of the
name. Thomas de Castleford, who was bred a
Benedictine monk, and who wrote the history
of this place, accounts for it by the following
miracle. William, Archbishop of York, and son
of the sister of King Stephen, returning from
Rome, was met by such crowds of people desirous
to see him and receive his blessing, that a
wooden bridge over the river Aire, near to this
place, gave way and broke down, by which
accident vast numbers fell into the river. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">{366}</span>
bishop, affected at the danger of so many persons,
is said to have prayed with such fervour
and success that no one perished. To perpetuate
so striking and so signal a miracle, the pious
Normans, says Thomas, gave the name of Pontefract
or Broken-bridge to this place.</p>

<p>The tower of York minster, distant upwards
of twenty miles, is distinctly visible from this
elevated rock. The situation of the castle contributed
greatly to its strength, and rendered it
almost impregnable. It was not surrounded by
any contiguous hills, and the only way it could
be taken was by blockade. The staterooms of the
castle were large, and accommodated with offices
suitable for the residence of a prince. The
style of the building shows it to be Norman;
though it has received various additions and improvements
of a later date.</p>

<p>The barbican was situated on the west side of
the outer yard beyond the mainguard. Barbicans
were watch-towers, meant for the accommodation
of the outer guard and for the protection of the
main entrance to the castle. They were sometimes
advanced beyond the ditch, to which they
were joined by drawbridges. The north side of
the barbican area was formed by the south wall
of the ballium or castle-yard, in the centre of
which was the porter’s lodge, the grand entrance
into the yard of the castle. The whole of this
area was sometimes called the barbican, and
within it stood the king’s stables and a large barn.
A deep moat was cut on the west side of the
castle. Within the wall of the ballium or great
castle-yard were the lodgings and barracks for
the garrison and artificers, the chapel of St
Clement, and the magazine. The magazine is
cut out of a rock, the descent to which is by a
passage four feet wide, with forty-three steps to
the bottom. Near this place was a large dungeon,
the entrance to which was at the seventeenth
step of the passage, and was a yard in breadth;
but it is now stopped up by the falling-in of
the ruins. The wall, as you descend these steps,
is inscribed with many names. The entrance
into the ballium was usually through a strong
machicolated and embattled gate between the two
towers, secured by a herse or portcullis. Over
this were the rooms intended for the porter
of the castle. The towers served for the <i>corps
de garde</i>. On an eminence at the western extremity
of the ballium stood the keep or donjon,
called the Round Tower. It was the citadel
or last retreat of the garrison. The walls of
this edifice were always of an extraordinary
thickness, and having in consequence withstood
the united injuries of time and weather, now
remain more perfect than any other part of
the castle. Here on the second story were the
staterooms for the governor. The lights were
admitted by small chinks, which answered the
double purpose of windows, and served for embrasures
whence the defenders might shoot with
long and cross bows. The different stories were
frequently vaulted and divided by strong arches;
on the top was generally a platform with an
embattled parapet, whence the garrison could see
and command the exterior works.</p>

<p>Tradition says Richard II. was confined and
murdered here by a blow with a battleaxe from
Sir Piers Exton. Fabian and Rapin inform us
‘that on Richard’s arrival at Pontefract Castle,
Sir Piers Exton is related to have murdered the
king in the following manner. On the king’s
arrival at the castle, he was closely confined
in the great tower. Soon after, Sir Piers Exton,
a domestic of Henry’s, was sent down with eight
ruffians to imbrue their hands with the blood
of this unfortunate king. On the day of their
arrival, Richard perceived at dinner that the
victuals were not tasted as usual. He asked
the reason of the taster; and upon his telling
him that Exton had brought an order against
it, the king took up a knife and struck him
on the face. Exton with his eight attendants
entered his chamber at that instant, and shutting
the door, attempted to lay hold of Richard.
He immediately perceived their fatal errand,
and knew he was a lost man. With a noble
resolution, he snatched a halbert or poleaxe
from the foremost of them and defended himself
so bravely that he slew four of his assailants.
Whilst combating with the rest of the murderers,
Exton got upon a chair behind him, and, with a
poleaxe, discharged such a blow on his head as
laid him down at his feet, where the miserable
king ended his calamities.’ Stow says ‘that the
most probable opinion is that he was starved
to death by order of King Henry IV., suffering
the most unheard-of cruelties, keeping him for
fifteen days together in hunger, thirst, and cold,
before he reached the end of his miseries.’</p>

<p>Henry IV., after his accession to the throne,
and during the whole of his reign, honoured the
castle at Pontefract, the paternal residence of his
family, by his frequent residence. Many state
documents were dated from this castle. After the
battle of Shrewsbury, in which fell the valiant
Hotspur and near six thousand of the rebels, the
king marched to Pontefract, to watch the motions
of the Scots and the Earl of Northumberland.
He granted full power to certain persons to treat
with the king of Scotland, in a document which
is dated at Pontefract Castle, August 6, 1403.
These and other similar acts of the king and
many of his successors originated in this celebrated
castle. Lord Rivers, Sir Richard Grey,
and Sir Thomas Vaughan, were executed in this
fortress in the reign of Edward V.</p>

<p>The castle of Pontefract was the only one that
held out against the parliament in the reign of
Charles I. The garrison long and obstinately
maintained themselves against the overwhelming
numbers of the besieging army under Fairfax,
until famine and reduced numbers compelled
them to capitulate. Great and numerous were
the deeds of heroism and daring displayed in
their sallies against their foes, who in more than
one encounter were put to rout. The besiegers,
seeing no prospects of taking the castle by the
breach they had made, began to mine, in order
to blow up some of the towers. On the discovery
of this, the garrison sank several pits within
the castle, and commenced their mines from
them. The number of pits within and without
the castle is said to have been above a hundred.
No great advance was made against the
brave defenders, even by the arrival of Cromwell
himself, who adopted every measure to compel
them to surrender the fortress. On the 30th
of January 1649, Charles was beheaded. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">{367}</span>
news of this event had no sooner reached the
garrison, than they loyally proclaimed his son,
Charles II. But the want of provisions and the
hopelessness of relief were stronger than the
enemy, and towards the end of March the
garrison walked out of the castle. In compliance
with an order, the fortress was dismantled,
and rendered wholly untenable for the future.
General Lambert, to whom the execution of this
order was intrusted, soon rendered this stately
and princely stronghold a heap of ruins. The
buildings were unroofed, and all the valuable
materials sold.</p>

<p>Thus fell this castle, which had successively
been the stronghold of the brave and warlike
Saxons, the residence of a proud and imperious
Norman conqueror, the turreted seat of the high
aspiring Dukes of Lancaster, the palace of princes
and of kings, at some periods a nest of treachery
and rebellion, and at others the last hope of
vanquished royalty.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOME_SIMILES">SOME SIMILES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">‘The</span> child of the past and the parent of the
future,’ is not an unhappy simile for the—present.
Happiness has been likened to a ghost; all talk
about it, but few, if any, have ever seen it. Ambition’s
ladder rests against a star, remarks a
clever writer, who also tells us that a proverb
is a short truth sandwiched between wit and
wisdom.</p>

<p>Eloquence is a coat of many colours judiciously
blended. No one thing will make a man eloquent.
Flattery has been termed a kind of bad money
to which our vanity gives currency. Society,
like shaded silk, must be viewed in all situations,
or its colours will deceive us. Kindness is the
golden chain by which society is bound together;
and charity is an angel breathing on riches; while
graves have been poetically called the footsteps
of angels.</p>

<p>Language is a slippery thing to deal with, as
some may find when selecting their similes.
Says a writer: ‘Speak of a man’s marble brow,
and he will glow with conscious pride; but allude
to his wooden head, and he’s mad in a minute.’
The young lecturer’s ‘similes were gathered in
a heap’ when he expressed the whole body of his
argument on Deceit in the following: ‘O my
brethren, the snowiest shirt-front may conceal
an aching bosom, and the stiffest of all collars
encircle a throat that has many a bitter pill to
swallow.’</p>

<p>Plagiarists are a species of purloiners who filch
the fruit that others have gathered, and then
throw away or attempt to destroy the basket.</p>

<p>It has been truly said that the abilities of man
must fall short on one side or other, like too
scanty a blanket when you are in bed: if you
pull it upon your shoulders, you leave your feet
bare; if you thrust it down upon your feet, your
shoulders are uncovered. The man, we are told,
who has not anything to boast of but his illustrious
ancestors, is like a potato—the only good
belonging to him being underground.</p>

<p>A man at a dinner in evening dress has
been likened to a conundrum: you can’t tell
whether he is a waiter or a guest. A Yankee,
describing a lean opponent, said: ‘That man
doesn’t amount to a sum in arithmetic; add him
up, and there’s nothing to carry.’ An American
critic in reviewing a poem, said: ‘The rhythm
sounds like turnips rolling over a barn-floor,
while some lines appear to have been measured
with a yard-stick, and others with a ten-foot
pole.’</p>

<p>An amusing illustration was given by a parent
when asked by his boy, ‘What is understood by
experimental and natural philosophy?’ The answer
was: ‘If any one wants to borrow money,
that is experimental philosophy. If the other
man knocks him down, that is natural philosophy.’
Curious and comical illustrations seem
natural to many children. A little girl, suffering
from the mumps, declared she felt as though
a headache had slipped down into her neck.
‘Mamma,’ said another youngster, alluding to
a man whose neck was a series of great rolls of
flesh, ‘that man’s got a double-chin on the back
of his neck.’ A little three-year-old, in admiring
her baby brother, is said to have exclaimed:
‘He’s got a boiled head, like papa.’</p>

<p>Talking of curious similes—among the southern
languages of India is the Teloogoo or Telinga,
so rough in pronunciation that a traveller of the
nation speaking it before a ruler of Bokhara,
admitted that its sound resembled ‘the tossing of
a lot of pebbles in a sack.’ A simile for scarlet
stockings is firehose—laughter is the sound you
hear when your hat blows off—and trying to do
business without advertising is said to be ‘like
winking at a girl in the dark.’ An unpoetical
Yankee has described ladies’ lips as the glowing
gateway of beans, pork, sauer-kraut, and potatoes.
This would provoke Marryat’s exclamation of,
‘Such a metaphor I never <i>met afore</i>.’ Much more
complimentary was the old darkey’s neat reply
to a beautiful young lady whom he offered to lift
over the gutter, and who insisted she was too
heavy. ‘Lor, missy,’ said he, ‘I’se used to lifting
barrels of sugar.’ Wit from a man’s mouth is
like a mouse in a hole; you may watch the hole
all day, and no mouse come out; but by-and-by,
when no one is looking for it, out pops the mouse
and streams across the parlour.</p>

<p>Marrying a woman for her money, says a philosopher,
is very much like setting a rat-trap and
baiting it with your own finger.</p>

<p>An American writer says: ‘A man with one
idea always puts me in mind of an old goose
trying to hatch out a paving-stone.’ An editor’s
simile of man’s career is summed up in the lines:
‘Man’s a vapour full of woes, starts a paper, busts,
and goes.’</p>

<p>We all recollect how the Bath waters were
associated in Weller’s mind with the ‘flavour of
warm flat-irons.’ The humorist who created that
character was often reminded of a printer’s parenthesis
by the appearance of a bow-legged child;
and the elongated pupils of a cat’s eyes before a
bright light were likened by him to ‘two notes
of admiration.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">{368}</span></p>

<p>Just as children call a locomotive ‘a puff-puff,’
savages will use sounding similes to supply the
lack of language. The war-rockets sent amongst
the Ashantees soon became known as ‘shoo-shoos,’
to describe their hissing; and we have heard that
a fieldpiece firing shell was referred to by some
of the Zulus as a ‘boom—byby;’ the first representing
the report of the gun, the second the
explosion of the projectile.</p>

<p>To touch on the poetic and romantic style of
similes. Moore, if we rightly recollect, sings of
‘rose-leaves steeped in milk’ as a simile for a
beautiful complexion. One of the gallant poets
of France wrote of Mary Queen of Scots that her
complexion was ‘clear as a white egg with a blush
on it;’ and it certainly is probable that Elizabeth
was as jealous of Mary’s wonderful complexion as
of her claims to the English throne. Beauty has
been called a solitary kingdom. Another writer
says: ‘The red, white, and blue—the red cheeks,
white teeth, and blue eyes of a lovely girl are
as good a flag as a young soldier in the battle of
life can fight for.’ A German poet refers to a
fishing-rod as being typical of a young girl. He
says: ‘The eyes are the hooks, the smile the bait,
the lover the gudgeon, and marriage the butter
in which he is fried.’ Matrimony has been well
likened to a barque in which two souls venture
forth upon life’s stormy sea with only their
own frail help to aid them; the well-doing of
their craft rests with themselves.</p>

<p>A French wit of a post-office turn of mind
evolves the following: ‘A married woman is a
letter which has reached its address. A young
girl is a letter not yet addressed.’</p>

<p>Home has been described as the rainbow of
life. A laughing philosopher once, in a moral
lecture, compared human life to a table pierced
with a number of holes, each of which has a peg
made exactly to fit it, but which pegs, being
stuck in hastily and without selection, chance
leads inevitably to the most awkward mistakes;
‘for how often do we see,’ the orator pathetically
concluded—‘how often do we see the round man
stuck in the three-cornered hole!’ Sir Walter
Scott, who alludes to this simile, says: ‘This new
illustration of the vagaries of fortune set the
audience into convulsions of laughter, excepting
one fat alderman, who seemed to make the case
his own, and insisted that it was no jesting
matter.’</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak smalltext" id="PROCESSIONARY_CATERPILLARS">PROCESSIONARY CATERPILLARS.</h2>
</div>


<p>In the month of February, these ‘processionary
caterpillars’—as they have come to be called—are
seen in large numbers both at Arcachon and
Biarritz. Sometimes chains of two and three
hundred may be observed marching in solemn
procession either on the <i>plage</i> or on the roads.
It is clearly seen that they choose the smooth
paths of life, as they are rarely, if ever, seen to
perambulate the sandy, uneven forest, from which
they emerge throughout the whole day. Not
unfrequently, they mount the steps of a villa, to
take a peep at the interior, to the dismay of
invalids unaccustomed to such extraordinary,
though perfectly harmless callers. On such occasions,
they divide into small detachments, as if
conscious that the presence of a whole battalion
might prove inconvenient; for at other times,
whatever be the length of the chain, or how oft
soever divided, they invariably unite, and the
one who starts as leader retains the post, as if by
common consent, until their return to the nests
they have left in the early morning. Alas! for
the fruit-trees that fall in their way on what may
be termed their foraging expeditions. They halt
many times to regale themselves on succulent
leaves, and when fully satisfied, return to their
nests in the evening. These nests are longitudinal
in form, similar to those of wasps, but smaller.
They are composed of the dry needle-points of
the pine, divided into minute particles; and are
ingeniously woven together by gossamer threads
as fine as those of the spider, but in appearance
so silky as to resemble the work of the
silkworm. As it covers the whole nest, the
intention is evidently to keep the fabric together.
Should any one, impelled by curiosity, attempt
to pull the nest to pieces, to discover more
of this texture, and afterwards touch his own
eyes, inflammation may set in, and even death
ensue. This enables us to understand how
injurious so virulent a poison must be to the
young trees. Many of large growth in the forest
of Arcachon have been completely destroyed by
these insects. They are never seen during the
great heat of summer. In mid-winter, they leave
the nests by shoals, unite, and burrow in the
earth. There, underground, the long chain forms
itself into a ball, and many of the caterpillars
die. After a time, the rest emerge from their
cocoon existence, and return to the trees, where
they make fresh nests on the deserted ones of
the preceding year.</p>
